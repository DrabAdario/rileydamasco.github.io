      About Me

Hi, I'm Riley Damasco—a passionate computer science and security student with a knack for game design. I love working on ambitious projects, and there’s nothing quite as satisfying as seeing an idea evolve into a fully realized project. I take great pride in my work, and I’m always driven to push projects to their fullest potential.

My approach is highly collaborative and idea-driven. I naturally step into leadership roles, but I make it a point to ensure that every team member has a voice. I believe that the best solutions come when diverse ideas are shared and combined.

When I’m not immersed in coding or designing innovative projects, you’ll often find me rock climbing or at the gym.     </p>
